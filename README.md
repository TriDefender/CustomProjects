## 2.5D Cartoon TPS Concept
This repository contains an HTML5 prototype and design outline for a 2.5D, cartoon-styled third-person shooter. Core behaviors include patrol/alert/attack enemy states, noise-driven AI reactions, and a dual-weapon player kit that balances stealth and power.

See [docs/game_design.md](docs/game_design.md) for the full design breakdown.

## Running the HTML5 Prototype
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use **WASD** to move, **mouse** to aim, **left click** to fire, and **1/2** to switch between the quiet repeater and loud thumper. Weapon noise radii visibly ping enemies into alert or attack states.
